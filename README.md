Credit cards will often use the Luhn algorithm to confirm the validity of a credit card number. First, implement the algorithm as a microservice and then expose the functionality with a JSON API.

This project is a web-enabled micro service. It accepts a credit card number in an HTTP request before returning a response. The response indicates whether the number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm.

Implementing this project requires a series of steps that looks something like this:


- Implement the Luhn algorithm
- Create an HTTP server
- Configure the server to respond to GET requests having a - JSON payload
- Accept valid JSON requests and proceed to step 5, whilst - rejecting invalid requests using an HTTP 400 status code
- Extract the credit card number from the JSON payload
- Run the Luhn algorithm on the number
- Wrap the result into a JSON response payload
- Return the payload back to the user through the HTTP server
